        The past decade of news stories show declining coverage on the prison by the popular press, while a number of people remain in detention.
        <p>
          Following the attacks on September 11th, 2001, scores of individuals were detained at the prison at Guantánamo Bay. 
          With indefinite sentences, and stripped of legal status, detainees at Guantánamo Bay were at the center of public discourse on human rights, counter-terrorism, and nationalism.
          In Guantánamo Bay (and in U.S. prisons and detention centers around the world), we have documentation of the widespread and gruesome torture of individuals detained. The impact of indefinite
         detention on the detainees and those connected to them remains largely un-explored in the mainstream media. 
      </p>
      <p>
          In 2009, President Obama signed an executive order to close Guantánamo Bay within a year. At the beginning of that year, 242 individuals were 
          held inside of the prison at Guantánamo Bay in 2010. As of May 2020, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/guantanamo">most recent count</a>
          has the prison population at 40. In contrast to a steady decline in the prison population between 2014 and 2016, the number of individuals detained from 2017 to present has dropped by one. 
        <p>
          In response to the continued operation of Guantánamo Bay as a detention facility, I 
          investigated how the media has covered the topic over the past decade.

          For this project, I collected the titles and sources of all articles published about Guantanamo Bay over the past 
         decade from 22 American mainstream media outlets. The date with the single most articles published was February
         23rd, 2016, with 121 unique articles. There was  also a spike in June 2014, when five people detained at Guantanamo Bay were
         transferred to Qatar in exchange for the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.
