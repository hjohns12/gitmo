        <h1>Who's Still Talking About Guantánamo Bay?</h1>
        <h2>The past decade of news stories show declining coverage of the topic by the popular press, while a small number of people remain in detention.</h2>

          Since the early 1990's, scores of refugees and suspected terrorists have been detained at Guantánamo Bay. In 2009, President 
          Obama signed an executive order to close Guantánamo Bay within a year. More than a decade later, forty individuals
          are still being held inside the prison. In response to the continued operation of Guantánamo Bay as a detention facility, I 
          investigated how the media has covered the topic over the past decade. 
       </p>
       <p>At the start of the decade, the number of individuals being held inside of the prison at Guantánamo Bay was 192. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/guantanamo">most recent count</a>
         has the prison population at 40. In contrast to a steady decline in the prison population between 2014 and 2016, the 
         number of individuals detained from 2017 to present has dropped by one.

          For this project, I collected the titles and sources of all articles published about Guantanamo Bay over the past 
         decade from 22 American mainstream media outlets. The date with the single most articles published was February
         23rd, 2016, with 121 unique articles. There was also a spike in June 2014, when five people detained at Guantanamo Bay were
         transferred to Qatar in exchange for the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.
